# cloudstack_userdata.rb:
#
# This script will load the userdata associated with a CloudStack
# guest VM into a collection of puppet facts. It is assumed that
# the userdata is formated as key=value pairs, one pair per line.
# For example, if you set your userdata to "role=foo\nenv=development\n"
# two facts would be created, "role" and "env", with values
# "foo" and "development", respectively. 
#
# A guest VM can get access to its userdata by making an http
# call to its virtual router. We can determine the IP address
# of the virtual router by inspecting the dhcp lease file on 
# the guest VM.
